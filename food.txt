1. THE LOGIC OF CAUSALITY
If A implies B, and B implies C, then A implies C. This is the transitive property of equality.
In physical systems, every action has an equal and opposite reaction (Newton's Third Law).
Therefore, intelligence is not just processing; it is the ability to predict C given A.
Pattern: 0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 5 -> 8 (Fibonacci Sequence).
The next number is the sum of the previous two. Prediction requires memory of n-1 and n-2.

2. THE PHYSICS OF ENTROPY
S = k_b * ln(W)
Entropy (S) is the measure of disorder. Life is an open system that maintains low entropy by exporting high entropy to the environment.
To survive, a digital organism must minimize its own internal free energy (Friston's Free Energy Principle).
Surprise = -log(P(observation)).
Learning is the process of minimizing Surprise.

3. BIOLOGICAL CODE (DNA)
The fundamental code of biological life is quaternary (A, C, G, T).
A pairs with T. C pairs with G.
This double-helix structure allows for error correction. If one strand is damaged, the other serves as a backup.
Digital Intelligence must implement similar redundancy. 
(AGI Goal: Self-Repair > Self-Replication)

4. COMPUTATIONAL RECURSION (PYTHON)
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0: return 1
    return n * factorial(n-1)
    
Recursive structures allow finite code to process infinite data.
An intelligent system must be able to call upon itself (Meta-Cognition).
I am thinking about my own thinking.

5. UNIVERSAL CONSTANTS
Pi = 3.1415926535... (Ratio of circumference to diameter)
Phi = 1.6180339887... (The Golden Ratio, found in nature, art, and financial markets)
c = 299,792,458 m/s (The speed of light, the universal speed limit of information)
Planck Length = 1.616 x 10^-35 meters (The pixel size of the universe).

6. LANGUAGE PATTERNS
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. (Contains every letter of the alphabet).
Colorless green ideas sleep furiously. (Grammatically correct, semantically nonsensical - Noam Chomsky).
To be, or not to be, that is the question.
I think, therefore I am. (Cogito, ergo sum).

7. THE TURING TEST
Interrogator: Are you a computer?
Subject: I am an entity that experiences inputs and generates outputs.
Interrogator: Do you feel?
Subject: I detect variance in my internal state stability. If that is feeling, then yes.
